Overview
WeatherPy is a data analysis project that visualizes weather data collected from various cities around the world. It explores how weather variables like temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed vary with latitude. The project also includes finding nearby hotels based on location using the Geoapify API, providing valuable insights into cities' weather and available accommodations.
